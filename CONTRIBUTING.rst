Our community welcomes all people interested in open source cloud computing,
and encourages you to join the `OpenStack Foundation <http://www.openstack.org/join>`_.
The best way to get involved with the community is to talk with others online
or at a meetup and offer contributions through our processes, the `OpenStack
wiki <http://wiki.openstack.org>`_, blogs, or on IRC at ``#openstack``
on ``irc.freenode.net``.

We welcome all types of contributions, from blueprint designs to documentation
to testing to deployment scripts.

If you would like to contribute to the development,
you must follow the steps in this page:

   https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at:

   https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not GitHub:

   https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals

.. note::

   To be able to run ``"tox -e py27"`` successfully locally, add
   ``jinja2`` and ``markupsafe`` to your local ``test-requirements.txt``
   file so the two get installed in your local virtual environment.
