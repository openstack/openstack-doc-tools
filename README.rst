Prerequisites
-------------

You need to have Python 2.7 installed for using the tools.

This package needs a few external dependencies including lxml. If you
do not have lxml installed, you can either install python-lxml or have
it installed automatically and build from sources. To build lxml from
sources, you need a C compiler and the xml and xslt development
packages installed.

To install python-lxml, execute the following based on your
distribution.

On Fedora, RHEL 7, and CentOS 7::

    $ yum install python-lxml

On openSUSE::

    $ zypper in python-lxml

On Ubuntu::

    $ apt-get install python-lxml

For building from source,  install the dependencies of lxml.

On Fedora, RHEL 7, and CentOS 7::

    $ yum install python-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel

On openSUSE::

    $ zypper in libxslt-devel

On Ubuntu::

    $ apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
